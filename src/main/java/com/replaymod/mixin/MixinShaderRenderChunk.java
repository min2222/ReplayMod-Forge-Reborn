     * So, for some reason OF though it'd be a good idea to drop the `shouldBuild` check from the chunk traversal in
     * the setupTerrain method (see the innermost if of the "iteration" profiler section).
     * Hint: It's not a good idea. It'll cause chunks to be queued for building which should not be built. And because
     * they don't know any better, they'll even re-queue themselves (which looks like a race condition in vanilla
     * MC) causing a live-lock when we try to force-build all chunks (or at least it would cause a lockup if it
     * wasn't for the vanilla race condition which slowly causes some of the rebuild tasks to get lost over time,
     * eventually, potentially all of them).
     * This is the most convenient place to re-introduce the check (setRebuildFrame would normally be called right after
     * shouldBuild, if it returns true).
